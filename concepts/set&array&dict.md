In Python, a set is an unordered collection of unique elements, a list is an ordered collection of elements that can be duplicated, and a dictionary (also known as a hash map) is an unordered collection of key-value pairs.

Here are some key differences between sets, lists, and dictionaries:

### Ordering

Lists are ordered collections, which means that the elements have a specific order and can be accessed by their index. Sets and dictionaries, on the other hand, are unordered collections, which means that the elements do not have a specific order and cannot be accessed by their index.

### Duplicates

Lists can contain duplicates, while sets cannot. If you try to add a duplicate element to a set, it will simply be ignored. Dictionaries also cannot contain duplicate keys, since each key in a dictionary must be unique.

### Key-Value Pairs

Dictionaries are collections of key-value pairs, where each key is associated with a specific value. Sets and lists, on the other hand, do not have this key-value structure.

### Performance

Sets and dictionaries are generally faster than lists for operations that involve searching for or adding elements. This is because sets and dictionaries are implemented as hash tables, which allow for constant-time lookups and insertions. Lists, on the other hand, are implemented as arrays, which require linear time to search for an element or insert a new element in the middle of the list.

Here are some examples of how to use sets, lists, and dictionaries in Python:

### Sets

```python
# Create a set
my_set = set()

# Add an element to the set
my_set.add(5)
my_set.add(4)

# Remove an element from the set
my_set.remove(4)

# Check if an element is in the set
if 5 in my_set:
    print("5 is in the set")

# Iterate over the elements of the set
for element in my_set:
    print(element)
```

### Lists
```python
# Create a list
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Add an element to the list
my_list.append(6)

# Remove an element from the list
my_list.remove(4)

# Check if an element is in the list
if 5 in my_list:
    print("5 is in the list")

# Iterate over the elements of the list
for element in my_list:
    print(element)
```

### Dictionaries
```python
# Create a dictionary
my_dict = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}

# Add a key-value pair to the dictionary
my_dict["country"] = "USA"

# Remove a key-value pair from the dictionary
del my_dict["age"]

# Check if a key is in the dictionary
if "name" in my_dict:
    print("name is in the dictionary")

# Iterate over the key-value pairs of the dictionary
for key, value in my_dict.items():
    print(key, value)

```
